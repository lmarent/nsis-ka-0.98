README: dist
------------
This is the NSIS-ka suite from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).
Home of the source code is here: http://nsis-ka.org/
or if this doesn't work, try https://svn.tm.kit.edu/trac/NSIS
The NSIS protocol suite is defined by the following documents:
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5971 (GIST)
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5973 (NAT/Firewall Signaling)
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5974 (Quality-of-Service Signaling)
http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5975 (QSPEC Template)

This is a distribution directory for all NSIS-ka components.  

Currently these are:

 Name		| Dependencies		| Base location
----------------+-----------------------+----------------------------
 protlib	| none			| PROTLIB_DIR
		|			| FQUEUE_DIR
 ntlp		| protlib		| NTLP_DIR
 qspec		| protlib		| QSPEC_DIR
 natfw-nslp	| protlib, ntlp		| n/a
 qos-nslp	| protlib, ntlp, qspec	| n/a

Each single component is contained in an own directory and 
knows its dependencies and will include and build  them as required. 

HOW TO COMPILE
--------------
This suite uses the autotools (automake, configure)
suite. If you've got the source code with a "configure" file,
simply run

./configure
make
make install

If the configure file is missing, you can create one if you
have autotools installed; simply run
make -f Makefile.svn
(which should run the command autoreconf --install for you)


OPTIONS
-------
You can pass the following options to configure:

(Protlib)
  --disable-debug         disable debug code (default: debugging enabled)
  --disable-logging       disable logging output (default: logging enabled)
  --enable-sctp           compile with SCTP support (default: SCTP disabled)
(GIST)
  --use-flowinfo          use flowinfo module for mobility support (default:
                          disabled)


PROBLEMS?
---------
In case of any problems, please check for any open/closed tickets
in our TRAC or try the latest trunk code from the svn:
svn co https://svn.tm.kit.edu/nsis/dist/nsis-ka/trunk/

DIRECTORY ORGANIZATION
----------------------
In order to find the sources the respective Makefiles take input from
``Makefile.inc'' which defines all required locations.

All locations are relative to DISTDIR.  This allows to build individual
components ``free-standing'' to support branch building without the
need to branch dist, maintain local ``svn:externals'' or ``svn
switch''ed working copies.  Instead one can checkout a base dist and
build a branch against this base by setting DISTDIR accordingly.
tools/mkbranch is a script that tries to do that automatically.

Further more individual components can be used from different locations
by setting the respective base location.

tools/tag-release is a tiny shell script that helps with release
tagging.  Given a name for the release it will produce a couple of svn
commands to copy the selected svn:externals into a tag-directory under
the dist hierarchy.
